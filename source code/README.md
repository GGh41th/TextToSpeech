# React App  

This is a simple interface for the text-to-speech application.  
I'm **by no means** a React or frontend developer ðŸ˜…, so I would be really happy if someone could improve the interface.

## Environment Variables  

You need to set the following environment variables:  

- **`COGNITO_IDENTITY_POOL_ID`**: Used in the `VoiceDropdown` component.  
- **`API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT`**: Used in the `App.js` file.

## Available Scripts  

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`  

Runs the app in development mode.  
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

- The page will reload when you make changes.  
- You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`  

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.  
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`  

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.  

- It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.  
- The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.  
- Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
