# <span style="color:#4CAF50;">React App: Text-to-Speech Conversion Using AWS Serverless Architecture</span>  

This project is an <span style="color:#FF9800;"><strong>MVP (Minimum Viable Product)</strong></span> that utilizes <span style="color:#2196F3;"><strong>AWS Lambda</strong></span> and <span style="color:#2196F3;"><strong>Amazon Polly</strong></span> to convert text into speech.  

## <span style="color:#673AB7;">Project Highlights</span>  
- <strong>Amazon Polly</strong> is a powerful text-to-speech synthesizer known for its realistic voice output.  
- Polly supports advanced features such as:  
  - <span style="color:#009688;">**Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)**</span> for customizing speech output.  
  - <span style="color:#009688;">**Bilingual**</span> and <span style="color:#009688;">**accented voices**</span> for enhanced language support.  

## <span style="color:#673AB7;">Current Scope</span>  
This MVP focuses on the core functionality of text-to-speech conversion. While Polly offers many additional features, they are not included in this version.  

## <span style="color:#673AB7;">Future Enhancements</span>  
I plan to integrate more features over time, including:  
- <span style="color:#FF5722;">SSML support for advanced speech customization</span>.  
- <span style="color:#FF5722;">Bilingual and accented voice options</span>.  
- <span style="color:#FF5722;">Other advanced capabilities Polly offers</span>.  

Feel free to <span style="color:#4CAF50;"><strong>fork</strong></span> this repository and implement these features if you'd like to contribute!
