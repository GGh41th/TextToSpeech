# React App: Text-to-Speech Conversion Using AWS Serverless Architecture  

This project is an **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** that utilizes **AWS Lambda** and **Amazon Polly** to convert text into speech. 

## Project Highlights  
- **Amazon Polly** is a powerful text-to-speech synthesizer known for its realistic voice output.  
- Polly supports advanced features such as:  
  - **Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML)** for customizing speech output.  
  - **Bilingual** and **accented voices** for enhanced language support.  

## Current Scope  
This MVP focuses on the core functionality of text-to-speech conversion. While Polly offers many additional features, they are not included in this version.  

## Future Enhancements  
I plan to integrate more features over time, including:  
- SSML support for advanced speech customization.  
- Bilingual and accented voice options.  
- Other advanced capabilities Polly offers.  

Feel free to **fork** this repository and implement these features if you'd like to contribute!

## Project Structure  
- **`aws-tf-infrastructure/`**: Contains the Terraform configuration for deploying the AWS infrastructure.  
- **`source-code/`**: Contains the React app source code.

Each directory includes a **README** file with more detailed information specific to that part of the project.
